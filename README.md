# Slip - Beautiful Note Taking

A modern, elegant note-taking application with theme-aware branding and beautiful design.

## Theme-Aware Logo System

This application features an intelligent logo system that automatically switches between light and dark versions to match the current theme mode:

### How It Works

1. **Theme Mode Matching**: The logo matches the current theme mode
2. **Smart Selection**: 
   - **Light mode** ‚Üí Light logo (black text on light background)
   - **Dark mode** ‚Üí Dark logo (white text on dark background)
3. **Seamless Transitions**: Logo changes smoothly when switching themes

### Logo Files Required

Place these logo files in the `public` directory:

- `slip-logo-light copy.png` - Light version with black text (for light mode)
- `slip-logo-dark copy.png` - Dark version with white text (for dark mode)

### Implementation

The `SlipLogo` component handles all the logic:

```tsx
// Automatically selects the right logo to match theme mode
const logoSrc = currentTheme.mode === 'light' 
  ? '/slip-logo-light copy.png'  // Light logo (black text) for light mode
  : '/slip-logo-dark copy.png';  // Dark logo (white text) for dark mode
```

### Fallback System

If logo images aren't found, the component gracefully falls back to an SVG version that also respects the theme colors.

### Usage

```tsx
import { SlipLogo } from './components/SlipLogo';

// Use anywhere in your app
<SlipLogo size="xl" />
```

Available sizes: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`
